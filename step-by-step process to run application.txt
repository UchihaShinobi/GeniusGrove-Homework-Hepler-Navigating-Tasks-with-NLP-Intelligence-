Here's a step-by-step process to run a Streamlit application:

(Certainly! Streamlit is a popular Python library for creating web applications with minimal effort)

Prerequisites:

1. Python Installation: Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Install Streamlit:

bash/command prompt: pip install streamlit

2. Run Your Streamlit App:

In the terminal, navigate to the directory containing your `app.py` file and run the following command:

bash/command prompt: streamlit run 1_Home.py

This command will start a development server and open your Streamlit app in a new browser window. You should see the title and message you defined in your `main` function.

By default, Streamlit will open your app in a web browser. The URL will be displayed in the terminal. Typically, it will be something like `http://localhost:8501`.

Make Changes and See Updates:

As you make changes to your `app.py` file, Streamlit will automatically reload the app in the browser. You can iterate on your app and see the changes in real-time.


That's it!
